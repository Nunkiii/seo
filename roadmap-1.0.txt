  Works on my laptop from scratch and on OARPAF pc. Both use apache2 with userdir mod.

OK  Setting the temperature to -10,0 (beware the locales of the browser for decimal comma.)
    and I check the box. temperature starts descending.
OK  I uncheck the box. Temperature start rising.
OK  I check the box again. Temperature restart descending.
NO  Temperature goes until -2,0 and keep descending. I decide to put it to -0,5.
    Temperature still descends. I try to set it with the input type number arrows or by
    focus and unfocus. No effect.
OK? Workaround: I uncheck and check the box: Temperature start descending and starts oscillating between -0.3 and -0,7.

OK  If I stop and restart the ws server while the fan is on, the last temperature setpoint is recorded.

NO  After first exposure, either with setpoint on or off, the fan stops.
CHK Fan restarts only during the exposure, after the reconnection with the Release/Use Camera button.  
NO  If I stop the ws server while the fan is stopped, the temperature starts rising, eventually the "hot" led switches on. 
NO  After first exposure, the plot monitor stops.

CHK Sometimes, starting exposure with no filter set and dark mode causes the header to be incomplete.
CHK Apparently, temperature can decrease also with ws server on and fan off. 

NO  Filter wheel in interface has no default.
NO  Filter wheel does not store last position and always goes until position zero before setting the filter
